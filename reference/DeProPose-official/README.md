# DeProPose: Deficiency-Proof 3D Human Pose Estimation via Adaptive Multi-View Fusion

Abstract—3D human pose estimation has wide applications
 in fields such as intelligent surveillance, motion capture, and
 virtual reality. However, in real-world scenarios, issues such
 as occlusion, noise interference, and missing viewpoints can
 severely affect pose estimation. To address these challenges, we
 introduce the task of Deficiency-Aware 3D Pose Estimation.
 Traditional 3D pose estimation methods often rely on multi
stage networks and modular combinations, which can lead to
 cumulative errors and increased training complexity, making
 them unable to effectively address deficiency-aware estimation. To
 this end, we propose DeProPose, a flexible method that simplifies
 the network architecture to reduce training complexity and avoid
 information loss in multi-stage designs. Additionally, the model
 innovatively introduces a multi-view feature fusion mechanism
 based on relative projection error, which effectively utilizes
 information from multiple viewpoints and dynamically assigns
 weights, enabling efficient integration and enhanced robustness
 to overcome deficiency-aware 3D Pose Estimation challenges.
 Furthermore, to thoroughly evaluate this end-to-end multi-view
 3D human pose estimation model and to advance research
 on occlusion-related challenges, we have developed a novel 3D
 human pose estimation dataset, termed the Deficiency-Aware 3D
 Pose Estimation (DA-3DPE) dataset. This dataset encompasses a
 wide range of deficiency scenarios, including noise interference,
 missing viewpoints, and occlusion challenges, thereby establishing
 a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating model robustness and
 performance under various demanding conditions. Experimental
 results demonstrate that DeProPose exhibits exceptional robust
ness and accuracy in deficiency-aware scenarios. Compared to
 state-of-the-art methods, DeProPose not only excels in addressing
 the deficiency-aware problem but also shows improvement in
 conventional scenarios, providing a powerful and user-friendly
 solution for 3D human pose estimation.
